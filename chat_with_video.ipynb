      "\n",
      "*   **It's a song:** The transcript is clearly lyrics to a song, likely in Marathi (based on some of the words).\n",
      "*   **Theme:** The song seems to be about partying, dancing, and enjoying music played by a DJ. It mentions drinking (\"quarter,\" \"glass\"), dancing (\"disco dancing,\" \"lezim\"), and a lively atmosphere.\n",
      "*   **DJ Focus:** The lyrics repeatedly call for the \"Dolby वाल्या (Wala)\" DJ, emphasizing the importance of the DJ and the sound system (Dolby).\n",
      "*   **Cultural Elements:** The song includes cultural references like \"Varati\" (wedding procession), \"Dandia,\" \"Govinda\" (likely referring to the Dahi Handi festival), and \"Pola\" (a festival).\n",
      "*   **Energy:** The language is energetic and informal, suggesting a fun and festive occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, the video is likely a recording of a high-energy Marathi party song that celebrates music, dancing, and the role of the DJ in creating a lively atmosphere. Does this help give you the context you were looking for?\n",
      "\n",
      "User: summarize the lyrics of the song\n",
      "Bot: Okay, I can summarize the lyrics for you. Here's a breakdown of the song's content:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Opening:** The song starts with an energetic call to bring on the music by Ajay-Atul (famous Indian music composers).\n",
      "*   **Party Time:** It describes a group of friends bored with mundane conversations and eager to go out and party. They head to a local spot (\"para\") where alcohol is available.\n",
      "*   **Call to the DJ:** The lyrics repeatedly emphasize calling the \"Dolby वाल्या (Wala)\" DJ, highlighting the importance of loud, high-quality music for their enjoyment.\n",
      "*   **Describing the Scene:** The song depicts people dancing wildly, comparing them to a wedding procession crasher (\"Varati\"), someone playing Dandia, a Govinda during Dahi Handi, and someone completely lost in the music and dance.\n",
      "*   **DJ's Performance:** The lyrics praise the DJ's skills in mixing music, playing popular songs, and creating a vibrant atmosphere. It mentions him playing music back-to-back and filling glasses (likely with drinks).\n",
      "*   **Friends' Antics:** The song describes friends teasing and supporting each other, with one friend pulling another back into the fun when he gets tired.\n",
      "*   **Celebration:** The lyrics mention celebrating festivals and traditions with the DJ's music, indicating that the music is suitable for various occasions.\n",
      "*   **Enthusiastic Closing:** The song ends with an enthusiastic call to the DJ and a repetition of the desire to have him play music.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the song is a celebration of friendship, music, dance, and the lively atmosphere created by a skilled DJ at a local gathering. It's a fun and energetic track meant to get people in the mood to party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want me to elaborate on any specific part of the summary?\n",
      "\n",
      "User: what is dolby\n",
      "Bot: Okay, let's talk about \"Dolby\" in the context of the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this song, \"Dolby वाल्या (Wala)\" likely refers to a DJ who plays music on a sound system that is associated with high-quality, loud, and immersive sound, similar to what you might experience with Dolby technology. It doesn't necessarily mean the DJ is exclusively using Dolby-licensed equipment. Instead, it's used as a colloquial term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that clarify what \"Dolby\" means in the song?\n",
