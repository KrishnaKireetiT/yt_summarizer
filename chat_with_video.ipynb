      "\n",
      "*   **Don't blindly follow tutorial makers:** They often don't have the best insights into the future, especially regarding rapidly evolving fields like AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Pay attention to experimental practitioners:** They might be working on things that seem strange or irrelevant now, but could be the future. Don't dismiss them just because you don't understand their work immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Build the future yourself:** The best way to predict the future is to experiment and create things. This gives you firsthand knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of new technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Focus on reasoning and problem-solving:** AI is increasingly handling the coding aspect of software development. Therefore, skills like problem diagnosis, communication, and understanding user needs will become more critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Adapt to the changing landscape:** AI advancements require a shift in focus from inputs (like writing code) to outcomes (building successful applications). Embrace new technologies and find ways to leverage them to achieve results quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The future involves managing AI agents:** As AI becomes more capable, the role of developers will evolve into managing and directing these agents, similar to managing people.\n",

      "Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or look for other pieces of advice within the transcript?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bot: Okay, let's break down how you can incorporate this advice into your real life:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Don't blindly follow tutorial makers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:** Be a critical consumer of online advice. Don't just follow tutorials step-by-step without understanding the underlying principles.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   When learning a new skill, seek out multiple perspectives and sources of information, not just one guru.\n",
      "        *   Try to understand the \"why\" behind each step in a tutorial, not just the \"how.\"\n",
      "        *   Experiment and deviate from the tutorial to see what happens and deepen your understanding.\n",
      "        *   Look for practitioners actively working in the field, not just those creating content about it. Follow their work, read their blogs, or attend their talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Pay attention to experimental practitioners:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:** Seek out and follow people who are pushing the boundaries of their fields, even if their work seems unconventional or hard to grasp.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   Identify leading researchers, developers, or artists in your areas of interest.\n",
      "        *   Follow their work on social media, attend their presentations, read their research papers, or contribute to their open-source projects.\n",
      "        *   Even if you don't fully understand what they're doing, try to grasp the general direction and potential impact of their work.\n",
      "        *   Don't be afraid to explore unconventional ideas and approaches in your own projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Build the future yourself:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:** Don't just passively consume information; actively create and experiment with new technologies.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   Start small, personal projects to explore new technologies or ideas.\n",
      "        *   Contribute to open-source projects.\n",
      "        *   Participate in hackathons or coding challenges.\n",
      "        *   Share your learnings and projects with others to get feedback and collaborate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Focus on reasoning and problem-solving:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:** Sharpen your critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. These will be essential as AI takes over more routine tasks.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   Practice breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n",
      "        *   Work on your communication skills (written and verbal) to effectively explain ideas and collaborate with others.\n",
      "        *   Seek out opportunities to solve real-world problems, either in your work or personal life.\n",
      "        *   Learn how to ask effective questions to diagnose problems and gather information.\n",

      "**5. Adapt to the changing landscape:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:** Be open to learning new skills and adapting to new technologies. Don't get stuck in old ways of thinking or working.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   Continuously learn and update your skills.\n",
      "        *   Be willing to experiment with new tools and workflows.\n",
      "        *   Embrace a growth mindset and be open to change.\n",
      "        *   Stay informed about the latest trends and developments in your field.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. The future involves managing AI agents:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Real Life:**  Start thinking about how AI can augment your abilities and how you can manage AI systems to achieve specific goals.\n",
      "    *   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "        *   Experiment with AI tools to automate tasks or improve your productivity.\n",
      "        *   Think about how you can delegate tasks to AI agents and monitor their progress.\n",
      "        *   Develop strategies for managing and coordinating AI systems to achieve complex goals.\n",
